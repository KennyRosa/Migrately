# Migrately
Web based company designed to simplify the U.S visa/immigration process for individuals by recognizing the right journey for an applicant to undergo.

As a web developer/software engineer, my goal for this project was to implement a landing page and create a forums section for applicants to create conversations based on their experience. I also did the following: 

- Produced and optimized a landing page using React, CSS3 and Bootstrap, while improving visuals and navigation for easy operation between users. 

- Developed and implemented a user-friendly landing page to boost interactiveness between individuals across the world seeking Visa and immigration eligibility. 

- Implemented React hooks, functional components composition and state management. 

- Simplified complex functions, provided easy syntax through proper naming conventions and extended the functionality of the browser by implementing built-in web APIâ€™s. 

- Utilized Git to track and manage changes to code. Received/provided constructive feedback to developers while indulging in source control. 

- Participated in daily stand-ups with a full stack development team, weekly coding sprint plannings and daily code talks.
